Chromeit is a small extension that adds functionality to Chrome's Omnibox. This allows you to just type in  '/r' and then a subreddit name on Reddit.com.

Basically, this was a quick script I threw together for a couple of reasons. 
1. I NEED MY REDDIT FIX!!! And I can be wasting two seconds typing in the full URL every time. :)
2. I've been getting into Chrome (as well as other browser) extension development lately, and Omnibox was one piece of it I hadn't played with yet.

Yes, right now this isn't much, but I'm wanting to continue playing with the extension and just see where else I can take it from here.
